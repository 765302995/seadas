##Reprojection

###Introduction

SeaDAS can re-project a source product to a target Coordinate Reference System.  The SeaDAS application reads-in an L2 file.

### Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, the user shall be able to

1) Learn about reprojection parameters, such as crs,

2) How to get valid values for parameters, and

3) Reproject a product to a target Coordinate Reference System.

### Steps

Users can reproject a source product to a target CRS in two ways. One easy way is to do it through "Reproject" operation's
 GUI interface located at "SeaDAS -> Tools -> Reproject" menu. The other slightly complicated but more flexible way is
 to do it through command line interface. We shall demonstrate operation steps for both approach.

#### Using SeaDAS Processing GUI

1. Start SeaDAS, open a source product. In this tutorial, we shall use Terra L2 file, T2005288185000.L2_LAC.

2. Go to Tools menu and select "Reprojection..." menu item.
