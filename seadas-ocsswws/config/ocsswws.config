# Configuration for the OCSSW RESTful Web Services runtime.
# All properties described here can also be passed to the VM as system
# properties using the standard Java
#   -D<property>=<value>
# syntax. In addition, it is possible to use macros of the form
#   ${<property>}
# within a value. Macros will expand to the value of the referred (system)
# property.
