L2gen design notes:

//todo Bug: Some events external to the tree are not being fully registering within the tree.
when "adg" product is SELECTED which means all children are selected
subsequent deselection of "adg_carder" via the "Selected Products Cart" results in
the expected deselection of "adg_carder" in the tree but the "adg" product is not set as expected to PARTIAL.
This because checkProductState and checkAlgorithmState need to be called.

//todo New: Categorization
We want to add a new layer of categorization as defined in the xml file productCategories.xml.
We want to combined the waveDependent and waveIndependent products together within this list.

//todo New: Product Tab Rearrangement
put the cart, wavelength selector, selected products list and tree all on one page.

//todo Bug: l2_prod entry is wrong
When waveDependent product a_412 is selected via the tree or Jlist it appears as a_412_ in the l2_prod parameter.

// todo wavelength selecter should not display iii checkbox if no IR bands available for current mission

// todo ifile ofile stuff

// todo make run button do something
