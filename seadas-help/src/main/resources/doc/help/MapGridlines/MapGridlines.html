<p>Map Gridlines have been significantly revised for SeaDAS 7.1 with a lot of new parameter option choices for the user.
    Below are some examples.<br>
</p>


<p>The following 4 images were created with SeaDAS using the same Chloryphyll product scene
    of a level-2 file. They show various applications of map gridlines along with the effects
    of reprojection on the map gridlines.

    </li>
    <li><a href="MapGridlines.html#Image3">Image 3</a> shows another variant of Image 2, but with labels placed inside
        the image

    <li><a href="MapGridlines.html#Image4">Image 4</a> shows another variant of Image 1, but with only corner labels
        and no gridlines

<p><b>Editing parameters of the map gridlines - </b>To edit any of the parameters click on the Layer Editors icon <img
        src="../visat/images/icons/LayerEditor24.png"
                                                                      border="0">.
    This will enable you to edit whichever layer is
    currently selected. If the Map Gridline layer does not show up in the Layer Editors window, then toggle the Map
    Gridlines button <img src="../visat/images/icons/GraticuleOverlay24.png" border="0">
    off then on, this will make the Map Gridline layer the selected layer. The Layer Manager window
    is another place where you may select a layer to be the selected layer.

    <br><br>

    The following image shows the user editable components of the map gridlines. Most fields are pretty
    self-explanatory. <br><br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Gridline Spacing - </b> The latitude and longitude step sizes may be set directly where the value represent
    degrees between the gridlines.
    Setting
    this field to zero results in Auto-Sizing. The Auto-Sizing algorithm will set the gridline spacing to a reasonable
    value such that there are about 3-5 lines. Also note that lines are placed at the nearest most sensible degree
    value.
    <br><br>
    <b>Font Sizing - </b> The user font settings are in term of points rather than pixels. This enables a single user
    font setting and default to work well with files of any resolution. Internally the font sizes are actually tied
    to the pixel sizes and there is a conversion of points to pixels being made.
    <br><br>

    <b>Low Resolution (in pixel space) Problems - </b> For files with an extremely low resolution image, less than
    about (100 x 100) pixels resolution,
    you may expect to see problems with the map gridlines, such as missing labels.


    <br><br>

    <b>Exporting an image with gridlines - </b> When exporting an image as a pixel-based file (for instance a png file),
    the gridline labels font text will of course be bounded and affected by the resolution of the exported file. To
    insure
    that the text looks good you will want to make sure the exported file is high resolution. To do this, right click on
    the image
    in SeaDAS then select "Export Image". To the left in the window which pops up, there are the options "Visible
    region"
    and "Full scene". <br><br> "Full scene" will export the image at the exact image resolution (it will not include
    anything outside
    the image - like gridlines labels, etc.). The fields below under "Image Dimension" are now tied to the number of
    pixels
    in the band. Even if you have chosen the labels to be inside, the image resolution will most likely
    adversely affect the look of the font.<br><br>
    "Visible region" will export based on the bounds defined by the image viewer window. This will enable the user to
    get the gridline
    labels into the exported file. The fields below under "Image Dimension" are now tied to the number of pixels in the
    viewer
    window on your monitor. For a publication quality image you will want to increase this. (Note: right now we haven't
    added
    in a fixed ratio feature so you will have to independently adjust both the "Width" and the "Height" fields by the
    same percentage.
    I find it easiest to increase by a factor of ten (just tack on a "0" to both the "Width" and "Height" fields.

    <br><br>

    <b>User Preferences</b>
    For this release most of the
    preferences have been removed, but decent automated defaults are being used which are dynamic to the image
    resolution. We do plan on updating the user preferences capabilities to include all the new options in a future
    release.
