<p>Map Gridlines have been significantly revised for SeaDAS 7.1 with a lot of new parameter option choices for the user.
    Below are some examples.<br>
</p>


<p>The following 4 images were created with SeaDAS using the same Chloryphyll product scene
    of a level-2 file. They show various applications of map gridlines along with the effects
    of reprojection on the map gridlines.

    </li>
    <li><a href="MapGridlines.html#Image3">Image 3</a> shows another variant of Image 2, but with labels placed inside
        the image

    <li><a href="MapGridlines.html#Image4">Image 4</a> shows another variant of Image 1, but with only corner labels
        and no gridlines

<p><b>Editing parameters of the map gridlines - </b>To edit any of the parameters click on the Layer Editors icon <img
        src="../visat/images/icons/LayerEditor24.png"
                                                                      border="0">.
    This will enable you to edit whichever layer is
    currently selected. If the Map Gridline layer does not show up in the Layer Editors window, then toggle the Map
    Gridlines button <img src="../visat/images/icons/GraticuleOverlay24.png" border="0">
    off then on, this will make the Map Gridline layer the selected layer. The Layer Manager window
    is another place where you may select a layer to be the selected layer.

    <br><br>

    The following image shows the user editable components of the map gridlines. Most fields are pretty
    self-explanatory. <br><br>
</p>


<img src="images/MapGridlines1.png" border="0"> <br><br>


<p>
    <b>Gridline Spacing - </b> The latitude and longitude step sizes may be set directly where the value represent
    degrees between the gridlines.
    Setting
    this field to zero results in Auto-Sizing. The Auto-Sizing algorithm will set the gridline spacing to a reasonable
    value such that there are about 3-5 lines. Also note that lines are placed at the nearest most sensible degree
    value.
    <br><br>
    <b>Font Sizing - </b> The user font settings are in term of points rather than pixels. This enables a single user
    font setting and default to work well with files of any resolution. Internally the font sizes are actually tied
    to the pixel sizes and there is a conversion of points to pixels being made.
    <br><br>

    <b>Low Resolution (in pixel space) Problems - </b> For files with an extremely low resolution image, less than
    about (100 x 100) pixels resolution,
    you may expect to see problems with the map gridlines, such as missing labels.


    <br><br>
    <b>Put Labels on Inside - </b> By default this checkbox is unchecked and the coordinate text labels are placed
    outside
    the image. This looks great and is our preferred look. But, keep in mind, that when an image window is first opened,
    the image fills the window (at least in one dimension). Toggling the
    gridline labels on and off doesn't affect the zoom of the image. So to view these "outside" labels, the user will
    need to zoom the
    image out.

    <br><br>
    <b>Exporting an image with gridlines - </b> Use the "Export Image" tool. This tool is located at File -> Export
    Utilities -> Image or it can be found in
    the drop down menu when the image is right clicked with the mouse. If your labels are "outside" the image then
    select "View Window" from the "Source Boundaries" panel. For more on this see
    <a href="../general/PublicationQualityImages.html">Publication Quality Images</a>.


    <br><br>

    <b>User Preferences - </b>
    For this release most of the
    preferences have been removed, but decent automated defaults are being used which are dynamic to the image
    resolution. We do plan on updating the user preferences capabilities to include all the new options in a future
    release.
