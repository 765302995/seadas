            - Straylight

        Bathymetry
            - Bathymetry values are now 'true depth' accounting for local water surface height instead of being relative to sea level
            - Bathymetry values are now in positive units.
            - Default bathymetry color scheme is in log space to better depict shallow water floor features.

        Color Palettes Added/Revised
            - Bathymetry color palette revised with a smoother transition from light blue-green to dark blue-green.
            - Various gradient palettes added.
            - Default (oceancolor_standard.cpd) revised to not use black at high saturation.

        Color Schemes:
            - Added a user-defined data file for generating custom schemes and/or overriding default schemes.
            - Added a user-defined data file for customizing the scheme selector
            - Added a wildcard feature to enable more generic auto-application of color schemes.
