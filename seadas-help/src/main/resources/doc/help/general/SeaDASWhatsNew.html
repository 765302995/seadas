SeaDAS 7.1 - Release Notes (9/17/2014)
============================================================================

The SeaDAS development team is pleased to announce the release of SeaDAS 7.1,
which is built atop slightly modified BEAM 5.0 version.

SeaDAS 7.1 is a significant release in several respects. It has a new user
interface with cleaner, simpler and more attractive layout which makes finding
and using tools easier. Frequently used tools have default behavior that reduces
user operation time. It also includes new tools, such as bathymetry and mask
tool and contour operator tool. In addition to new features, it includes bug
fixes and feature enhancements for the previous versions.

Graticule tool is improved significantly:
- Users can control label location, label angle, line spacing, font size,
    tick-marks, border, widths, colors, and transparencies;
- Default behavior produces a good auto-spaced grid-lines on any image with
    just one click.

Color-Bar tool is improved:
- Users can control number of tick-marks, decimal places, font size, manually
    entered points, scaling factor, color-bar sizing and transparency.
- Color-bar can now be put as a layer on top of the image.
- Default behavior produces a good color-bar with just one click.

Major revision to Color Palette Tool:
- Color schemes selector enables easy selection of product specific
    and custom schemes.
- Saves and stores selected scheme and palette name.

Changed wording to avoid confusion.

Changed the default background and no-data colors.

Geometries are now selectable and movable.
Geometries can now be defined with entered coordinates.

The help page structure has been reorganized, and an overview page has been
    added which briefly describes the most commonly used components with their
    menu locations.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed reported bugs from SeaDAS 7.0.2
- Fixed issues with log scaling in Color Palette tool and Color-bar tool.
- Fixed issues related to vector layer
- Fixed issues with coastline dimap saving
- Fixed issues with multi-processor
- Fixed issues with SeaDAS help

    have wording and/or feature discrepancies.
