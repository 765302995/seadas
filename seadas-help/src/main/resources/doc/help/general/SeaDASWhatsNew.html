<h3>SeaDAS 7.0</h3>

<p>SeaDAS 7.0 is the first official release of the Java version of SeaDAS.  Previous releases (i.e. version 6.4 and prior)
were developed using the Interactive Data Language (IDL) as a basis for the GUI platform.  The SeaDAS 7.0 GUI is based
on the BEAM software (version 4.11) [http://www.brockmann-consult.de/cms/web/beam/].</p>
