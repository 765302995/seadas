    FEATURE ADDITIONS/MODIFICATIONS

        -   Universal Color Palette. Updated this palette to Version 3 which has a slightly
            darker and pale greener center. Several versions of this palette exist and are
            placed (hidden from the GUI) in the extras folder.

        -   RGB tool: added button for setting each RGB channel, min=0 and max=1.  This
            feature is especially useful when using any of the rhos based rgb profiles which
            were designed to be optimally used with a color ramp of [0,1]. Greatly improves
            time needed to do this as before one had to type the numbers in.

        -   Menu reorganization/renames: minor reorganization in the direction of what we
            anticipate to be the SeaDAS 8 configuration.
                - "DataProcessing" changed to "OCSSW".


    BUG FIXES

        -   In Color Manager disabled the "apply palette to other bands" feature due to it's
            not supporting the latest color scheme configuration.

        -   Fixes broken link in the color scheme selector.

        -   Fixes problem where color bar would not always display the end point label when
            used in manually entered points mode.


    HELP PAGES

        -   Updated Pixel Extraction help page to clarify the formats for coordinate parameter
            input file.

<p class="h3better">Help Pages</p>

<p>
    Some of the help pages internal to SeaDAS 7.3 have not been revised to match the current version so there can be
    some wording discrepancies as well as feature description differences.  However, we regularly produce video help
    tutorials <b>(http://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/tutorial)</b>.  We feel this to be the best, most functional way to
    enable the user of SeaDAS to get the most out of the software.  In additional we regularly respond to SeaDAS issues
    on the our user forum
    <b>(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/forum/oceancolor/forum_show.pl).</b>  Questions posted on
    the forum help aid us in determining aspects of SeaDAS which may benefit by refinement, as well as give us ideas
    for topics to be used in future tutorial videos.  Also note that these internal help pages are alos made available at
    <b>(http://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/)</b>
</p>


<p class="h3better">Notes on Upgrading your SeaDAS version</p>

<p>
    <b> If you already have SeaDAS version 7 or higher installed:</b><br>
    In your home directory there is a directory titled '.seadas'.  This contains version-specific preferences
    and defaults.  This directory also contains any custom color palettes and rgb-profiles which you may have
    created.  Because of this, a seadas installation will automically move and rename the previous '.seadas'
    directory putting it in your home directory.  When seadas is launched and does not find this '.seadas'
    directory, it will automically create this directory and initialize it with the package settings and defaults.
    You can then manually copy any of your custom color palettes and rgb-profiles from the backed up copy
    of your previous version's '.seadas' directory over into the '.seadas' directory.
