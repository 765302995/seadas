PRIMARY PACKAGE

    FEATURE ADDITIONS/MODIFICATIONS

        - OCSSW Processing
            Windows Support


        - Statistics Tool
            Major revision to this tool.

            1.  Revision (GUI)
                a. Can be run simultaneously for multiple bands (no longer limited to a single band)
                b. Regional and quality masking options
                c. Bin count, and other binning parameters can be set.  (Note: the related accuracy setting has been
                    removed.  "Bin Width" field was previously named "Max Error")
                d. More statistics fields added
                e. Changed "Median" field to be a true calculation of the median.  This field is optional since this
                    calculation can take longer on very large files.  (Note: previously the median was a binned
                    calculation dependent on the bin size.)
                f. A large number of metadata fields added such as Satellite, Platform, Resolution, Time and much more.
                g. Convenient spreadsheet display added.
                h. Plot formatting added.
                i. Percentile plot is now percentile on y-axis and data on x-axis.
                j. Some delayed screen repaint issue have been resolved.
                k. Preferences page has been added.
            2.  Revision (GPT)
                a. Adds the same statistics fields as the GUI (although does not add the metadata fields)
                b. Uses bin count "numBins".  (Note: the related accuracy setting has been removed.)
                c. Added field "calculateMedian".


        - Reproject Tool
            1. Masking (both GUI and GPT)
                    Validation masking feature has been added. 
                    Masks can now be applied to constrain which pixels of the source file are eligible for reprojection.  
                    This feature also enables the user to deactivate the valid pixel expression of the source file and 
                    carry the valid pixel expression over into the reprojected file.  
            2. Metadata (both GUI and GPT version)
                    Reproject tool specific metadata is now written to the output file.
            3. Organization (GUI only)
                    Minor rewording of a few parameters and tabs of the GUI

        - Navigation Tool Window (GUI)
            1. Zoom all now behaves as a toggle between 100% zoom and 116% zoom for convenience of displaying gridlines
               labels which are outside of the data window.


        - Math Band Tool
            1. Retain source data (GPT)
                    Option to transfer data from source file to output file.  Previous version only created new bands
                    based on the source file data but did not retain the source file data.
                    

        - RGB Image Profiles (GUI)
            1. A large amount of rgb configuration files (rgb_profiles) have been added.  These include true color
                and many false color configurations.

        - Coast, Land, Water Tool (GPT) "LandWaterMask"
            1. This is now fully supported and works in GPT mode.  All GUI features have been added in as parameters
                    in the operator.  Option to transfer data from source file to output file.

        - Level 2 File reader
            1. Mask "Quality_L3" revised
                    "HISATZEN" has been added to this mask composite to reflect the flags used in OBPG level3 processing.



    BUG FIXES

        - Time Series Tool - bands names were being naming based on local machine time zone, now they use UTC.


    HELP PAGES
                
        - Help
            1. Statistics Tool (major revision)
                    The Statistics tool itself has been significantly revised and the help pages are updated accordingly
                    with a lot more detail about this tool.
            2. Reproject Tool (major revision)
                    This is a major revision of this page.  The information here can also be useful in understanding some
                    of the related map projection tools (Orthorectification, Mosaic and Collocate)
            3. GPT Cookbook
                    Many examples of running the most common SeaDAS tools directly from the command line.  These
                    examples feature the command line arguments along with the full contents of the graph files 
                    and parameters files.
            4. OCSSW Cookbook
                    Very new, so very few entries this release.
            5. Menu organization
                    Adds a multitude of direct links to various internal help pages for ease of access within
                    the help menu.  Adds many relevant web link to the help menu.

NOTES

    Some of the help pages internal to SeaDAS 7.5 have not yet been revised to match the current version so there can be
    some wording discrepancies as well as feature description differences.  We also produce video help
    tutorials <b>(https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/tutorial)</b>.  In addition, we regularly respond to SeaDAS issues
    on the our user forum
    (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/forum/oceancolor/forum_show.pl).  Questions posted on
    the forum help aid us in determining aspects of SeaDAS which may benefit by refinement, as well as give us ideas
    for topics to be used in future tutorial videos.  Also note that these internal help pages are alos made available at
    (https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/help/)

    If you already have SeaDAS version 7 or higher installed:
    In your home directory there is a directory titled '.seadas'.  This contains version-specific preferences
    and defaults.  This directory also contains any custom color palettes and rgb-profiles which you may have
    created.  Because of this, a seadas installation will automically move and rename the previous '.seadas'
    directory putting it in your home directory.  When seadas is launched and does not find this '.seadas'
    directory, it will automically create this directory and initialize it with the package settings and defaults.
    You can then manually copy any of your custom color palettes and rgb-profiles from the backed up copy
    of your previous version's '.seadas' directory over into the '.seadas' directory.
