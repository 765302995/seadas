<h3>BEAM Session</h3>

<p>
    A BEAM <i>session</i> comprises all currently opened products and all opened
    <a href="ProductSceneView.html">image views</a>. Since BEAM 4.6, sessions
    can be stored and restored to and from a <i>session file</i>. A session file has the
    standard file extension <b><code>.beam</code></b>. If you have selected to create
    a file association with VISAT session files during installation, you can double-click
    session files in your file system which will invoke VISAT and restore the session.
</p>

<p>In VISAT, all session related commands are available from the <a href="FileMenu.html">file menu</a>.
    Here you can 
    <a href="FileMenu.html#saveSession">save</a>,
    <a href="FileMenu.html#openSession">open</a> and
    <a href="FileMenu.html#closeSession">close</a>
    a session.
</p>

<p>
    If you store the your opened products next to the session file, the file pathes to
    the products are stored as relative pathes. This means that you can take the parent folder of the
    session file and move it somewhere else in your file system without breaking the file references
    to the products. This is possible because the parent folder is self-contained with respect to the stored
    BEAM session.
