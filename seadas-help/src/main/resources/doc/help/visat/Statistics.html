<p class="subSectionTitle">Overview</p>

<p>
    The Statistics tool enables you to process and view statistics and relevent metadata for any file loaded within
    SeaDAS.  The statistics result can be refined to a particular region of interest and masking criteria.  The statistics
    may be done for a single band or simultaneously for any and/or all bands within a file.  A spreadsheet captures
    these statistics for easy viewing and export to other spreadsheet program.  A histogram and percentile plot can also
    be simultaneously generated.

</p>

<p>This tool is available both from the GUI and from the
    command
    line.
</p>

<p>

    Figures 0 illustrates the results of applying this tool to a level-2 file.

<p>
    <i><b>Regional and Validation Masking</b></i>
</p>

<p>
    SeaDAS enables the masking out of unwanted pixels, so that the statistics can be done on only the pixels which
    meet the masking criteria.  Conceptually, there are 2 types of masking, region-of-interest (ROI) and validation.
    The first type is region based where you have
    defined a specific area of interest on the Earth, and pixels outside of this are intended to be masked out.  Region masking, by
    it's very nature is stable across time and not effected by temporal changes such as atmospheric parameters, sunglint, straylight, etc.
      These latter parameters can be considered validation parameters.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>For the GUI:</b><br>There are 2 methods
    by which SeaDAS applies the masks. Y ou may select a mask of a region (or many region masks) within
    the Statistics Tool GUI and these are your ROI masks.  If you right click on a band
    in the File Manager, go to Properties you will find the Valid Pixel Expression and this is where the validation masks are applied.

</p>
<p class="i1">
    If you stay within the rigid constructs of the meaning these 2 masking tool parameters, then you would adjust the validPixelExpression to include
    the atmospheric, sunglint, straylight, etc. parameters
    However, adjusting the validPixelExpression for each band is probably not the most convenient way to run the statistics tool from the GUI.  Instead,
    you may want to create a new mask in the Mask Manager which is a composite of the region(s) and the validation masks (for
    example: MY_MASK = MY_REGION && !STRAYLIGHT && !HIGLINT).  This new composite mask could then be selected within the Statistics GUI
    as the mask to do the statistics on.  Conversely, (but you probably won't want to do this), you could inject the region
    mask into the validPixelExpression.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <i>Note: when you select multiple masks within the Statistics GUI, it will generate one set of statistics for each mask selected.
        It will not combine these masks together into a single mask.
        </i>
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <b>For GPT:</b><br>Again there are 2 methods by which SeaDAS applies the masks
     but with is a slight nuanced difference when running from the command line.  In this case, relevant to the description above,
    you can supply as parameters a shapefile and a validPixelExpression.  The shapefile automatically loads into SeaDAS, and creates
    the region of interest mask.  If you want to added in validation masking you will need to do this with the validPixelExpression.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <i>Note: when editing the validPixelExpression to include any custom validation parameters, keep in mind that you are overwriting the
        default validPixelExpression (for example for chlor_a you will want to do something like this: chlor_a > 0.001 &&
        chlor_a <= 100 && !STRAYLIGHT && !HIGLINT).

    </i>
</p>


<br>
<br>

<p>
    <i><b>Statistics and Mapped Imagery</b></i>
</p>

<p>
    In general, it may be best to consider mapping a file one way for statistics and another way for displaying data.
    For statistics you are best served using an equal area map projection (such as Albers Conic Equal Area, Lambert
    Azimuthal
    Equal Area, Sinusoidal, ...). With an equal area projection, the Earth surface area is the same for each resultant
    pixel and can be treated as such with an equal per pixel weighting. However, for large scenes, an equal area map
    projection
    may not look natural so using a conformal projection (such as Mercator and Stereographic) is
    more ideal when displaying this type of imagery.
</p>
<p>

    <i>Note: selection of the "best" map projection is dependent on scene size (is it global, regional, local), scene
        shape
        (does it run narrow north-south, narrow west-east, or is it more square in shape), and scene location (is it at
        the
        equator, at one of the Poles, or some span of latitudes somewhere between the Pole and equator.</i>

</p>

<br><br>

<p>
    <i><b>Statistics on Virtual Files and Virtual Bands</b></i>
</p>

<p>
    Statistics done on a virtual file can be extremely slow.  And if done on a chain of virtual files
     can bog down to the point where the computer memory or some other issue just won't let
    the operation proceed.  Try to avoid where possible these chains of virtual files and bands.  If the file on which
    you are about to do statistics is a virtual file, you should consider first saving it (which transforms it into a real file),
    and then generating your statistics.

    (See <a href="../general/Files.html" class="invisibleLink">Virtual, Real and System Files</a> for more)
    </p>
<p>







</p>



<br>
<br>

<p>
    <i><b>Metadata Fields</b></i>
</p>

<p>
    Metadata fields can be included with the statistics output.  These fields are invaluable in documenting your statistics,
    especially if you run statistics and export the results individually for many files, and then gather it all together
    into a spreadsheet package or other package.  Unlike statistics, which are precise numbers generated by exact
    algorithms based on data, metadata is quite dependent and reliant on the type and source of the file.  SeaDAS makes
    its best effort at gathering together the metadata of a file to include with the statistics.  This help document
    defines how each metadata field is searched for within a file.
</p>





<a name="Fields"></a>

<p class="subSectionTitle">Fields</p>

<p>
    This is a description of each of the fields generated.
</p>
<br>



<p>
    <i><b>Statistics</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Pixels</b><br>This is the total number of "valid" pixels used to calculate the statistics.
</p>

<p class="i1">

    <i>Note: this does not include pixels which do not contain data.</i>
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Minimum</b><br>This minimum value of the "valid" pixels.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Maximum</b><br>This maximum value of the "valid" pixels.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Mean</b><br>This mean value of the "valid" pixels.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Median</b><br>This median value of the "valid" pixels.  Calculated by converted 2d raster of "valid" pixels into
    an array and then obtaining the center element of the array.
</p>
<p class="i1">

    <i>Note: versions of SeaDAS prior to 7.5 calculated the median by binned the data and then obtaining the 50 percentile
        value.  This method is a quicker calculation especially in the case of a large data set, but is dependent on the bin size.
        This field is still available as the'Median(Binned)' field.  </i>
</p>

<p class="i1">

    <i>Note: because, especially for larger files, the processing time can increase, this field is optional and you can
        set whether or not to have the median generated. </i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Standard_Deviation</b><br>This minimum value of the "valid" pixel.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Coefficient_of_Variation</b><br>Standard_Deviation / Mean.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Percent Thresholds</b><br>Calculated based on a histogram defined by binning the data.  This is dependent on the
    number of bins.
</p>


<br>
<p>
    <i><b>Band MetaData</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    This is information about the band.  It is obtained directly from the loaded band.  If you wish to edit this
    band information within the SeaDAS GUI, right-click on a band in the FileManager, then select Properties, then
    edit the fields.  Now when you run statistics, your edited value will appear in the results.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Band</b><br>The band name.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Unit</b><br>The geophysical unit of the value represented in the band.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Band_Valid_Expression</b><br>Short for "Valid Pixel Expression" of the band.  This is a logical mathematical
    expression of validation criteria specific to the band which is applied per pixel to determine whether the band
    pixel is valid.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Band_Description</b><br>A description of the band.
</p>


<br>
<p>
    <i><b>File MetaData</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    This is information about the file.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File</b><br>The name of the file "as loaded" into SeaDAS.  The file name can be changed within SeaDAS, yet
    the original file still exists on your machine.  If you change the file name within SeaDAS (File Manager: right-click
    file, then Properties, then edit Name), this new file name will be the name displayed by this field.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File_Format</b><br>This is the format of the file "as loaded" into SeaDAS.  SeaDAS contains internal readers
    for many satellites and data levels.  If you open the file in the GUI the default way (File > Open), then SeaDAS will
    determine which reader to use on the file.  For example a standard OB.DAAC level-2 file when loaded in will use a
    level-2 file reader resulting in field "File_Format=SeaDAS-L2".  If you instead import the file using
    File > Import > NetCDF-CF, the NetCDF-CF reader will be invoked and the resulting field will be "File_Format=NetCDF-CF.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File_Type</b><br>This is the file type determined "as loaded" into SeaDAS.  It is dependent on the reader used
    internally within SeaDAS to load the file.  It follows the same logic used in obtaining the "File_Format" mentioned
    above and is somewhat similar in meaning to that field.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File_Width</b><br>The width of the file raster.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File_Height</b><br>The height of the file raster.
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Sensor</b><br>The name of the sensor which acquired the data.  This field is obtained from the Global
    attributes of the metadata.  The following attribute names are searched: "sensor_name", "instrument", "sensor".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Sensor".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Platform</b><br>The name of the platform (satellite) on which the sensor is mounted which acquired the data.
    This field is obtained from the Global
    attributes of the metadata.  The following attribute name is looked for: "platform".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Platform".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Resolution</b><br>The ground surface resolution (at nadir) of the data.  This field is obtained from the Global
    attributes of the metadata.  The following attribute names are searched:  "spatial_resolution", "resolution".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Resolution".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Day_Night</b><br>Indicates whether the data was imaged during daylight or at night.
    This field is obtained from the Global attributes of the metadata.
    The following attribute names are searched: "day_night_flag", "day_night".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Day_Night".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Orbit</b><br>The orbit revolution count of the satellite.
    The following attribute names are searched: "orbit_number", "orbit".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Orbit".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
    Files may span multiple orbits so this is searched as well.
    The following attribute names are searched: "start_orbit_number", "end_orbit", "end_orbit_number", "end_orbit".
    If anything is found within this orbit number span search then the start and end orbit number are assigned to
    the statistics field "Orbit".

</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Processing_Version</b><br>The processing version of the software which created the file.
    This field is obtained from the Global attributes of the metadata.
    The following attribute names are searched: "processing_version".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Processing_Version".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Projection</b><br>The map projection of the file.  If the file currently has a coordinate reference system
    defined for it within SeaDAS, then this is displayed along with the words "(obtained from CrsGeoCoding)".
    If not, then an attempt is made to obtain this from the Global attributes of the metadata.
    The following attribute names are searched: "map_projection","projection", "crs".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Projection"
    along with the words "(obtained from MetaData)".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
    Lastly, if no projection has been found then a java class is displayed.  OB.DAAC level-2 files will indicate
    the class "BowtiePixelGeoCoding".
</p>


<br>
<p>
    <i><b>Mask MetaData</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    This is information about the mask.  It is obtained directly from the loaded mask.  If you wish to edit this
    mask information within the SeaDAS GUI, this can be done in the MaskManager.   Now when you run statistics, your
    edited value will appear in the results.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Mask</b><br>The mask name.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Mask_Description</b><br>A description of the band.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Mask_Expression</b><br>This is a logical mathematical expression of criteria specific to the mask which is
    applied per pixel to determine whether the mask is on or off.
</p>


<br>
<p>
    <i><b>Time MetaData</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    This is information about the file.  It is obtained directly from the loaded file.  If you wish to edit this
    time information within the SeaDAS GUI, right-click on the file in the FileManager, then select Properties, then
    edit the time fields.  Now when you run statistics, your edited value will appear in the results.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <i>Note: if the file end time is earlier than the file start time, then the statistics tools will switch these
        two time fields to be in correct time order.</i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Start_Date</b><br>The date portion of the file start time.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Start_Time</b><br>The time of day portion of the file start time.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>End_Date</b><br>The date portion of the file end time.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>End_Time</b><br>The time of day portion of the file end time.
</p>


<br>
<p>
    <i><b>Time Series MetaData</b></i>
</p>

<p class="i1">
    This is information about the band.  This is intended
    to be used on files created by the SeaDAS TimeSeries tool.  The TimeSeries tool generates a single projected and collocated
    file from multiple input files each of a specific time.  Each band in the output file came from a source file and
    the band is named based on the time of the input file.
    So the statistics tool obtained the time series metadata directly from the name of the band.  If you wish to edit this
    time information within the SeaDAS GUI, right-click on the band in the FileManager, then select Properties, then
    edit the band name.  Now when you run statistics, your edited value will appear in the results.

</p>


<p class="i1">
    <b>Date</b><br>The date portion of the band time.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Time</b><br>The time of day portion of the band time.

    of the statistics results (sush as decimal places) as well as to adjust some formatting to the spreadsheet.  The
    line separator within this tab delineates the aspects which are only applicable to the spreadsheet.
    Parameters listed below the separator are only applicable to the spreadsheet.

    <b>Decimal Places</b>
</p>


<p class="i2first">
    For numbers which are not integers, this sets the number of decimal places.

<p class="i1hang">
    <b>Column Width</b>
    </p>


<p class="i2first">
    Sets the displayed width of the columns within the statistics GUI spreadsheet.
    Setting the column width to a value of less than 8 will result in this field being
    ignored such that the columns will auto-adjust to show the full text entry for all entries.
</p>

<p class="i2">
    <i>Note: If an entry
        cannot fit within the column width, it will be partially display.  Even though the full entry is not displayed, it is
        there in full and the spreadsheet can be saved to the clipboard and
        copied into another program.

<p class="i1hang">
    <b>Include Column Breaks</b>
</p>

<p class="i2first">

    in the statistics GUI spreadsheet.

<ul>
    <li>Version 7.5
        <ul>
            <li>Major rewrite of the statistics tool (both GUI and GPT) - besides the added parameters, fields and metadata,
                the "true" median is now available.  Previous versions used a quicker binned calculation of the median.
                The current version is now multi-band instead of limited to single band.</li>
            <li>Major rewrite of the help page</li>
        </ul>
